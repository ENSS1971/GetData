# GetData
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Assinment Goal

Project instructions
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a dataset. The goal is to prepare organized data that can be used for further analysis. I am sending the following files:

1) a dataset organized as described below;
2) a codebook that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean the data, called CodeBook.md
3) Include a README.md in the repository with my scripts.
